* Cardano Commands path to Metadata Json file bug
SCHEDULED: <2022-02-12 Sat>

** TODO Correct chdir for all commands

~cardano-commands~ should able to find pool-metadata json. Currently it looks into the ~cold-keys~ folder.

<2022-02-07 Mon>

Looks like I have to do a lot of rewrite to stream like the steps. Currently TK (pool owner) and me (pool operator) has to do a lot of manual work of remember steps.

Choosing to have a step-by-step command line interface using Typescript + [[https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js][Inquirer]] library.
