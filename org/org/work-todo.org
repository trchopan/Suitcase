* TODO Cardano Commands path to Metadata Json file bug
SCHEDULED: <2022-02-12 Sat>

** TODO Rewrite the cardano-commands scripts into a more robust project

Purpose is to facilitate the design of Secret <-> Core interaction.

Use 2 main library for this task: [[https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js][Inquirer]] and [[https://github.com/Berry-Pool/cardanocli-js][CardanocliJS]]


** DONE Relay config missing Connected Peer metrics

Missing ~TraceBlockFetchDecisions = true~ in the Cardano config.json making the node not tracing connected_peer metric.


** DONE Correct chdir for all commands

~cardano-commands~ should able to find pool-metadata json. Currently it looks into the ~cold-keys~ folder.

<2022-02-07 Mon>

Looks like I have to do a lot of rewrite to stream like the steps. Currently TK (pool owner) and me (pool operator) has to do a lot of manual work of remember steps.

Choosing to have a step-by-step command line interface using Typescript + [[https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js][Inquirer]] library.


* DONE Move my new configs and setup from PERSONAL to WORK
