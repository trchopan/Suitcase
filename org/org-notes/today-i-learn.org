#+DESCRIPTION: My note book of things I learned during my day

I started using Emacs about a week ago <2022-01-24 Mon> . With such powerful tool I think I should begin the habbit to write things down. Hopefully it will improve my workflow and help me into a more organised mode.

* Day 1 <2022-01-27 Thu>

My first day of writing in org mode.

Recap of what I learned during the journey of setting up Emacs:

** Doom emacs is awesome
All battery included. Tempting to do a Emacs from Scratch but it must comes later right not Doom Emacs is surficial.

** Seting up Vue and conflict / old package
Setting up Vue was a pain because the old package [[https://github.com/AdamNiederer/vue-mode][vue-mode]] <= DO NOT USE this.
Vue has the new language server named [[https://github.com/jadestrong/lsp-volar][Volar]] . Use this instead.
